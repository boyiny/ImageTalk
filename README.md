# ImageTalk

This repository contains the code and example workflows for **ImageTalk**, a multimodal text-generation system designed to support people living with Motor Neuron Disease (plwMND) in augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) contexts.

ImageTalk was developed through both proxy-user-based and end-user-based iterative design phases, enabling efficient articulation of user needs and communication intent. The system achieves **95.6% keystroke savings**, maintains consistent performance, and received high user satisfaction ratings. It also contributes three design guidelines for AI-assisted text-generation systems and introduces four user-requirement levels tailored for AAC.

For full details, please refer to the accompanying paper.
